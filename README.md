# Osu!Highscore
## Overview
The main function is that the Servo will rotate and hold a physical flag whenever the associated account gains PP (and therefore reaches a highscore) on the game Osu!. Targeted for the Arduino MKR1000 (other WiFi enabled boards should work fine), the code connects to the profile page api, records the score, and flags if that score is updated from the last time it has been read.
## Hardware
Main:
* Arduino MKR1000 (or any similiar wifi enabled board).
* Servo, connected to a PWD pin (5), VCC and GND. Include a 100Î¼F capacitor in parrallel with the VCC and GND.
Being phased out:
* LED, connected to a digital pin (3) and GND through a 220ohm resistor.
* Button, connected to VCC, GND (with pulldown resistor) and a digital pin (0).
## Usage
1. Setup the hardware.
2. Download this software.
3. Rename "yourcodeshere.h" to "wificodes.h".
4. Edit the file from the previous step. The API key and querystring can be tested by appending them to osu.ppy.sh and putting the resulting string into a browser. A JSON file should be returned.
```objectiveC
char ssid[] = "YOUR WIFI SSID HERE";
char pass[] = "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD HERE";
String apikey = "YOUR API KEY HERE";
String query = "/api/get_user?u=YOUR USERNAME HERE";
String keyIndex = 0;//<--Enter an integer only for WEP connections, see next part.
```
5. This code deals with WPA (therefore most) WiFi encryption, if you are using WEP or an open network, tweak osuhighscore.ino to replace `status = WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);` with either:
```C++
status = WiFi.begin(ssid); //FOR NO ENCRYPTION.
status = WiFi.begin(ssid, keyIndex, key); //FOR WEP ENCRYPTION.
```
6. Upload the code to the arduino and make some good Osu! plays.
## Dependencies
All of the dependencies are available for download in the Arduino IDE library manager.
* Servo (usually pre-installed) (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo)
* WiFi101 (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFi101)
* ArduinoJson (https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)

## Software
The software is very WIP, I'll update this shortly.
